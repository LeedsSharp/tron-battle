# Introduction

This repo supports the Leeds Sharp session from Thursday, 29 June 2017. 

In this session, we'll be explaining in detail popular game theory algorithms such as the Minimax algorithm, Alphaâ€“beta pruning algorithm, and also the flood fill algorithm, and pathfinding algorithms to combine them all into an AI bot that will compete against other bots live on the big screen.
